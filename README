                          swiss ui - A Neutral jQuery UI Theme

This jQuery UI theme is developed with grace and flexibility
in mind. Like the great Swiss typefaces of the last century,
swiss ui aims to provide a theme, that doesn’t push itself to
the fore.
  Rather it is designed to be used in as many heterogenuous
environments as possible. Take a look at the demo page [1] to
get an impression of how swiss ui interacts with different
backgrounds. The widgets keep neutral and replace eye-catching
extravagance with simple elegance.

If you’re looking for a more stylish theme, let me suggest
“Aristo” [2] to you. It’s a port of Cappuccino’s interface to
jQuery UI.
  The theme is licensed under the same terms as jQuery UI
itself, namely the MIT license and the GPL v2.
  The source code is hosted at GitHub [3], together with a bug
tracker and forking possibilities. Any feedback is appreciated!

swiss ui is created by Manuel Strehl [4].
